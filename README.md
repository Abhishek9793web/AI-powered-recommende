# 🩸 Smart Blood Matching & Transfusion Recommender

## 📅 Date: Jun 20, 2025  
**Owner:** Abhishek Goswami  
**Event:** Hackathon | Calendar Meeting

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
Thalassemia patients require frequent and safe blood transfusions. However, mismatched blood units can lead to:
- Allergic reactions
- Alloimmunization
- Delays due to rare compatibility issues

Current systems match primarily based on blood type, ignoring:
- Antibody profiles
- Transfusion history
- Minor blood group antigens

> ❌ There is no intelligent system to optimize blood matching beyond ABO & Rh typing.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution  
Build an **AI-powered transfusion recommender system** that:
- Parses transfusion history, antibodies, and lab reports using NLP
- Matches patients with the most compatible donor blood units
- Minimizes adverse reactions by considering deeper compatibility
- Suggests best-fit units from existing blood inventory

## ⚙️ Core Functionality  

### 🔹 Patient Data Input
- Blood type, minor antigens, transfusion history
- Upload lab reports (PDF, text, scanned)

### 🔹 Donor Blood Inventory Upload
- Unit data: blood type, antibodies, availability

### 🔹 NLP Parser
- Extract key info from unstructured text (reactions, history, antibody data)

### 🔹 AI Matching Engine
- Score available units based on compatibility
- Recommend top 1–3 safest units

### 🔹 Risk Alert System
- Warns of no compatible unit found
- Suggests rare donor requests when needed

## ⚠️ Challenges & Constraints

- 🧪 Limited access to anonymized, real-world data  
- 🧬 Complex modeling of rare antigen behaviors  
- 📄 Medical reports vary in format (PDFs, handwriting)  
- 🏥 Integration with hospital systems may be difficult in MVP
